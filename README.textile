h1. navigateToWindow()

navigateToWindow() is a package-level ActionScript function that encapsulates all of the logic around opening a browser popup window from within Flash.

The function works very similarly to "navigateToURL()":http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/net/package.html#navigateToURL() except that you call it with the parameters that JavaScript's "window.open":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.open might expect.

The "test/patternpark/net/NavigateToWindowTest.as test case":http://github.com/alimills/navigatetowindow/blob/08a58132098406a72731b27e16004850da3d7c3f/test/patternpark/net/NavigateToWindowTest.as demonstrates how you might use navigateToWindow()

One of the unique and interesting features of this implementation is that the developer doesn't have to write any JavaScript in the HTML page wrapping the SWF.  Using a method derived the ideas of "Abdul Qabiz":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/ and his post "A MXML component that embeds JavaScript in html":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/macromedia_flex/a_mxml_component_tha.php, "Doug McCune":http://dougmccune.com/blog/ and his post "Multi-line strings in Actionscript 3":http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/05/15/multi-line-strings-in-actionscript-3/, and "Jordan Ambra":http://www.zorked.com/ and his post "Popups Blocked in AS3 with navigateToURL()":http://www.zorked.com/flash/flash-and-navigatetourl-popup-blocking/ we are able to execute all necessary JavaScript directly from ActionScript.
