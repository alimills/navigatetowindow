h1. navigateToWindow()

navigateToWindow() is a package-level ActionScript function that encapsulates all of the logic around opening a browser popup window from within Flash.

The function works very similarly to "navigateToURL()":http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/net/package.html#navigateToURL except that you call it with the parameters that JavaScript's "window.open":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.open might expect.

The "test/patternpark/net/NavigateToWindowTest.as":http://github.com/alimills/navigatetowindow/blob/08a58132098406a72731b27e16004850da3d7c3f/test/patternpark/net/NavigateToWindowTest.as file demonstrates how you might use navigateToWindow().

One of the unique and interesting features of this implementation is that the developer using it doesn't have to write any JavaScript. Using a method derived from the ideas of "Abdul Qabiz":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/ and his post "_A MXML component that embeds JavaScript in html_":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/macromedia_flex/a_mxml_component_tha.php, "Doug McCune":http://dougmccune.com/blog/ and his post "_Multi-line strings in Actionscript 3_":http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/05/15/multi-line-strings-in-actionscript-3/, and "Jordan Ambra":http://www.zorked.com/ and his post "_Popups Blocked in AS3 with navigateToURL()_":http://www.zorked.com/flash/flash-and-navigatetourl-popup-blocking/ we are able to execute all necessary JavaScript directly from ActionScript.
